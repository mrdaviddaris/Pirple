Let's look at a popular logical argument

All men are mortal
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, socrates is mortal.

let Men = ["mortal", "carbon-based", "biped"];
let Socrates = Men
if Socrates === Men

//Using "if statements" and any other logical 
//operators and data-types you see fit, recreate 
//this logical argument:
//All men are mortal
//Socrates is a man.
//Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

//1. Your code should make 
//clear that "socrates" is part of a collection 
//of items (Array or Object) referred to as "men".
//2. All members of this collection are mortal. 
//3. Since "socrates" is part of this collection, 
//he is mortal as well.

Got the hang of creating a logical 
argument? Want to try another one? 
Try this one as well:

This cake is either vanilla or chocolate.
This cake is not chocolate.
Therefore, this cake is vanilla.
