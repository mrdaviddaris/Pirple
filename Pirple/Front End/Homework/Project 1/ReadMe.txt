Pirple Staff:

I know many of the elements and attributes I used in our most recent homework assignment are no longer wanted in HTML5.
I did this to allow the use of frames despite the fact the world is now using CSS for this. I know we are about to 
transition to CSS in the next lesson and I wanted to do as much in html as I could, even if it meant using outdated
methods.

I also sacrificed content for formatting and coding since I had to dig pretty deep to get the code and figure it out.
Thanks!
