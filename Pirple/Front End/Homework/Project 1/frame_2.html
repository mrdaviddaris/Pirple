   <p>The first Stephen King book I read was <em>Carrie</em> (1974) and it illustrated to me how different a book and a movie
      can be. It was a very intense book and the movie, while memorable, ended up being more about high school cruelty than the supernatural.
      the same can be said for Christine, also a very supernatural book which lost intensity on the movie screen.</p>
   <p>I think Stanely Kurbrick was the ideal director for the screen-adaptation of <em>The Shining.</em> His memorable use of hollow background 
  music, ponderous scenes which start banal and end shockingly, and his use of wide-camera angles as well as a perceived first-person perspective
create an atmosphere of dread. It also allows the audience  to share in the main character's descent into madness, a difficult task for any direction.</p>
   <p>Still, the book was so much scarier. </p>
   <p>The book tells the story of recovering alcoholic John "Jack" Torrance, a struggling writer and his family. Coming back from a particular low spot in 
     his life that culminated in breaking his small son's arm, Jack gets a job for the winter as caretake of the Overlook Hotel. The Overlook has a very interesting
    past to include a couple of her caretakers going crazy and killing their famlies.</p>
   <p>Running parallel to this story is Jack's son Danny. Danny has growing psychic abilities, what the janitor of the Overlook calls <em>the shining.</em>
  The two find they can not only converse between each other without talking, but each is finely attuned to the supernatural horrors that exist within the hotel.
We learn their is an old and abiding evil lurking in the hotel that influences Jack and threaten the welfare of his young family</p>
  <p> Jack's descent into madness includes many conversations with the Overlook's former murderous caretakers, now haunting the hotels confines. Along with bevy of 
    vengeful ghosts, evil spirits, and the like, they make for very interesting company over the long, lonely winter.</p>
  <p>It takes the movie a little bit to establish the supernatural events occuring at the hotel but the book launches into it immediately. Also, there are many scenes
    outside the hotel where the creepiness occurs, even in the sunlight. Sculpted hedges stalk Danny and barely seen eyes watch from the corners. Stephen King
    able to establish the hotel as a malevolent environment from the outset and continues to pile on events and intensity until the book reaches its  climax.</p>
  <p><h4>I strongly recommend reading it!</h4></p>
  <p>For those who have seen the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. It is truly a masterpiece of modern horror, one of my favorite book. It will give you the 
    willies and they will stay with you long after you close the book, especially as you read it. Mr. Kubrick did a great job and as good as could be done. It is 
    understandable that every detail, thought, and event in a book cannot be translated to the big screen. For this reason - and more - get <em>The Shining</em>
    and treat yourself to a truly scary read.</p>
